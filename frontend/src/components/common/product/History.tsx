        A Legacy Forged in the Middle Belt: The Origins of Our Handcrafted
        Footwear
      </h2>

      <p className="py-2">
        Our story begins in Nigeria's culturally rich Middle Belt, a region
        renowned as a crossroads of diverse ethnic groups like the Tiv, Idoma,
        Ebira, and Berom. For generations, leathercraft has been more than a
        trade here—it's a living tradition. Artisans in this heartland have
        passed down the intricate skills of tanning and shoemaking, utilizing
        locally sourced hides and time-honored techniques that speak to both
        resilience and artistry.

      <p className="py-2">
        Historically, communities across northern and central Nigeria, including
        those in the Middle Belt, were known for their skilled leatherwork,
        producing everything from functional sandals to elaborate, bead-adorned
        boots signifying status. While the nearby tanneries of Kano and Sokoto
        gained international acclaim, the Middle Belt nurtured its own distinct,
        community-based craftsmanship, often centered around family workshops.

      <p className="py-2">
        Our footwear is a modern tribute to this legacy. We honor the region's
        deep-rooted heritage by collaborating with local artisans, preserving
        traditional hand-stitching and Goodyear welting methods. Each pair is a
        continuation of a story centuries in the making, where every stitch
        connects the ancient skill of the Middle Belt to contemporary design,
        creating footwear that is not just worn, but experienced.
